# Design Customizations

This resume design provides, for some kind of content, diferent locations and styles.
All this toggles are activated by `javascript` and are all gathered in the config file `theme-config.json`.

> Note: Whenever you change this file you need to rebuild or export again the resume.

Below is the content of the file:

```json
{
    "avatar": true,
    "sidebarSkills": true,
    "sidebarLanguages": true,
    "sidebarInterests": true,
    "sidebarAwards": true,
    "sidebarPublications": true,
    "sidebarCertifications": true,
    "sidebarReferences": true,
    "sidebarVolunteer": true,
    "workDuration": true,
    "educationDuration": true,
    "volunteerDuration": false,
    "awardDateSince": false,
    "certifcationDateSince": false,
    "watermark": true
}
```


1. `avatar`

   Will toggle displaying the user avatar (`basics.picture`)

2. `sidebar[Section]`

   Some sections could be located either on the sidebar in a more compact form or in the page as another regular section.

   If you set the variable to `true` that section will show up in the sidebar instead of in the right content pane.

3. `[section]Duration`

   Some sections, whenever you fill up `startDate` and/or `endDate` the date range will appear above the job position. If you leave this variable as `true` then also the duration (endDate - startDate years/months) will show up.

4. `[section]DateSince`

   Some sections, whenever you fill up `date` the time that past sinde that date to today will show up (Ex: 3 years ago).

   If you set this variable to `false` such period won't show up.

5. `watermark`

   For those proud of beign javascript developers, if you leave this variable to `true`, a subtle watermark will show up on the top right part of the same page stating this resume was generated by javascript.
